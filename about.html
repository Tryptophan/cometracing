			<h1>About Comet Racing</h1>
            <img class="chapter-header" src="img/header.png">
			<p>Comet Racing is a group of dedicated and passionate UT Dallas students who will design, manufacture and race an open wheel formula-style race car to compete in the national Formula SAE Championship.<br><br>We recognize the need for students to take the concepts they learn in the classroom and apply them to real-world situations. Our student team members gain invaluable experience with practical engineering application and solving real-world challenges.<br><br>In addition to designing, building, testing and racing the car, our members are responsible for all aspects of managing the race team. Including project management, budgeting, sponsorship, procurement, and outreach.</p>

            <h1>About Formula SAE</h1>
			<p>The Formula SAE competition is organized by SAE International (formerly Society of Automotive Engineers). SAE is a global association of more than 138,000 engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries.<br><br>SAE International is the leader in connecting and educating engineers while promoting, developing, and advancing aerospace, commercial vehicle, and automotive engineering. Formula SAE is the largest of the SAE-sponsored student design competitions within its Collegiate Design Series.<br><br>During the four-day event, Comet Racing will compete among a field of over 100 schools from around the world. Our race car will be judged on the vehicle's design, cost, innovation, safety, and performance, as well as our team's ability to present the engineering concepts used to develop the final design.</p>
