    <h1>Sponsorship</h1>

    <p>UTD Motorsports is a student-run organization that depends entirely on the monetary, material, and product
        donations as well as technical support and training from businesses and individuals. Without the
        incredibly generous support of our partners, UTD Motorsports, and its substantial benefit to students and
        industry, would cease to exist.<br><br>We work closely with our partners, who provide crucial support,
        and help to further the team's capabilities. We are proud to represent UTD Motorsports and we hope you will
        support our efforts.<br><br><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/utdmotorsports">Become a partner today! &rarr;</a></p>

    <h2>Partnership Benefits</h2>
    <div class="sub-paragraph">
    The Formula SAE competition is one of the best real
    world projects an engineering student can participate
    while an undergrad. Due to the large scope and
    immense complexity of designing a vehicle system,
    participating students are able to apply the knowledge
    they’ve accumulated through course work as well as
    get real world experience in both design and
    manufacturing that will better prepare them for
    industry. The entire project is student funded, so
    raising funds for manufacturing costs is a high
    priority.
    <span class="sub-title">Access to the next Generation of Engineers</span>
    Sponsors have a lasting relationship with future engineers.
    Introducing students to companies through sponsorship makes a
    lasting impression because it allows them to become familiar with
    the company’s products and services, while building a relationship
    that continues after graduation.
    <br><br>
    We recognize the need for students to take the concepts they
    learn in the classroom and apply them in real-world situations. Our
    student team members gain invaluable experience through hands
    on engineering application and real-world problem solving.
    <br><br>
    In addition to designing, building, and racing the car, our
    members are also responsible for all aspects of managing the race
    team. Project management, budget, sponsorship, and media are all
    handled by the team. The advanced development of these skills has
    made Formula SAE students highly desirable to companies such as
    SpaceX, Sauber F1, and General Motors.
