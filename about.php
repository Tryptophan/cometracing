    <img class="chapter-header" src="resources/img/header.png">
    <p>UTD Motorsports is a group of dedicated and passionate UT Dallas students who will design, manufacture and
        race an open wheel formula-style race car to compete in the national Formula SAE Championship.<br><br>We
        recognize the need for students to take the concepts they learn in the classroom and apply them to
        real-world situations. Our student team members gain invaluable experience with practical engineering
        application and solving real-world challenges.<br><br>In addition to designing, building, testing and
        racing the car, our members are responsible for all aspects of managing the race team. Including project
        management, budgeting, sponsorship, procurement, and outreach.</p>

    <h1>About Formula SAE</h1>
    <p>The Formula SAE competition is organized by SAE International (formerly Society of Automotive Engineers).
        SAE is a global association of more than 138,000 engineers and related technical experts in the
        aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries.<br><br>SAE International is the leader in
        connecting and educating engineers while promoting, developing, and advancing aerospace, commercial
        vehicle, and automotive engineering. Formula SAE is the largest of the SAE-sponsored student design
        competitions within its Collegiate Design Series.<br><br>During the four-day event, UTD Motorsports will
        compete among a field of over 100 schools from around the world. Our race car will be judged on the
        vehicle's design, cost, innovation, safety, and performance, as well as our team's ability to present
        the engineering concepts used to develop the final design.</p>
